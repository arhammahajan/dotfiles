## Credits

Large parts of this repo are adapted from two excellent open-source projects.
All credit for the original structure, ideas, and configuration goes to their authors.

### [josean-dev/dev-environment-files](https://github.com/josean-dev/dev-environment-files) — Josean Martinez

The development-environment side of this repo is based on Josean's setup:

- **Neovim** — the `lua/arham/` layout, `lazy.nvim` bootstrap, and the plugin
  selection (Telescope, nvim-cmp + LuaSnip, Treesitter, nvim-tree, lualine,
  gitsigns, which-key, trouble, conform, nvim-lint, auto-session, and friends)
  all follow his config. `colorscheme.lua` is a lightly customised version of
  his `tokyonight.nvim` theme, and LSP servers/formatters via `mason.nvim`
  mirror his list.
- **WezTerm** — `.wezterm.lua`, including the "coolnight" palette that also
  appears in his Alacritty themes.
- **tmux** — `.tmux.conf` derives from his (sensible defaults, TPM,
  `vim-tmux-navigator`, `tmux-resurrect` / `tmux-continuum`, `tmux-tokyo-night`),
  with a custom `Ctrl-\` prefix and extra keybindings.
- **Alacritty** — trimmed derivative of his terminal config.

### [Zproger/bspwm-dotfiles](https://github.com/Zproger/bspwm-dotfiles) — ZProger

The window-manager "rice" is based on ZProger's Arch + bspwm build:

- **bspwm** — `bspwmrc` (borders, gaps, pointer actions, rules, autostart) and
  the `picom_configurations/`.
- **polybar** — `config.ini`, `modules.ini`, `colors.ini`, `launch.sh`.
- **sxhkd** — `sxhkdrc`, including his keybinding philosophy and the
  `~/bin/*` script hooks.
- **rofi** — `config.rasi` and the bundled Catppuccin theme.
- **dunst** — `dunstrc`.
- **ranger, redshift, zathura, flameshot** — configs carried over and adapted
  from his `config/`; the Alacritty window opacity/blur settings also come from
  his terminal config.

If you like this setup, please go star and follow those repositories — they are
the reason it exists.
